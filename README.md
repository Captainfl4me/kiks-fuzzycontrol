# Fuzzy Logic Control of a Mobile Robot

Implementation of a Fuzzy Inference System to control a mobile robot as a wall follower.

This projet is self containing but depends on KiKS that can be found at the root as an archive.

## Install KiKS

It is a quite simple process. Simply extract the archive somewhere as long as it is in the Matlab path. Then, run kiks_setup inside Matlab to initialize it. Then, you can simply run kiks command to open up the interface and load an arena. Then, move the robot where you want it to start and run navigate.m.

## Result

Screenshots and analysis can be found on the report attach to the Release.
